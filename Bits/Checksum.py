# Title: Checksum in Python
# Author: Micha≈Ç Kotecki
# Date: 5/23/2020
# Description:
# Checksum is a hash number of a text. Checksum is commonly used in data transmission.
#
# Example
# User A sends a message to user B.
# They want to be sure message did not get corrupted, while being send (by internet connection problems)
# and user B got the EXACT message user A sent.
# User A calculates a checksum and sends it with message to user B.
# User B receives the text message and uses it to calculate checksum.
# User B compares his/her checksum with the checksum he/she got from user A.
# If the checksum is identical, then the probability data got corrupted during the transmission is very low.
# If the checksum is different, it is CERTAIN that the data got corrupted.
#
# It is very important to create the checksum in such a way, that the probability of getting the same number for different text is very low.
#
# Hash function are used to get a hash number (checksum). There are many hash functions.
# Below I implemented two of them:
# 1. DJB / Bernstein hash / Chris Torek hash
# 2. Adler-32

    P = 65521

    for character in data:
        A = (A + ord(character)) % P
        B = (B + A) % P

    return (B << 16) + A

        if len(randStringList) > 1:
            print(randStringList[0], randStringList[1], checksum)
            break
