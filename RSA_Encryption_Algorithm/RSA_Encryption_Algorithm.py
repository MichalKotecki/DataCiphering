# Title: RSA Encryption Algorithm in Python
# Author: Micha≈Ç Kotecki
# Date: 5/11/2020
# Description:
# The best, most popular encryption algorithm.
# It is an important part of the Internet security system.
# It relies on the time complexity of 'Prime Factorization'.
# RSA stands for Rivesta Shamira Adleman - 3 people, who invented the algorithm.
#
# Concept:
# This is an asymetric algorithm.
# Everybody owns two keys: a private key and a public key.
#
# RSA uses:
# 1. Diffie-Helman Key Exchange
# 2. Modular Inverse algorithm
# 3. Euler's Phi Function
# 4. Euler's Theorem

import secrets
from ModularInverse import ModularInverse
from Key_Exchange import Diffie_Helman_Key_Exchange

# GCD stand for Greatest Common Divisor
def GCD(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return GCD(b % a, a)

# Euler's totient function / Phi function.
#
def phi(num):
    result = num
    p = 2

    while (p * p <= num):

        if (num % p == 0):
            while (num % p == 0):

                num = num // p

            result = result * (1.0 - (1.0 / (float)(p)))

        p = p + 1

    if (num > 1):
        result = result * (1.0 - (1.0 / (float)(num)))
    return (int)(result)



def RSA():
#  1. Choose p and q. Both of them must be prime numbers.
    p = 11
    q = 17
#  2. Calculate p * q
    n = p * q
#   3. Calculate Euler's totient function / Phi function.
    # phi(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)
    print("phi(n)" ,phi(n))
    print("(p-1) * (q-1)", (p-1) * (q-1))
#   4. Find e. e needs to satisfy 2 conditions:
#                   *   1 < e < phi(n)
#                   *   GCD(e, phi(n)) = 1
#   To find e we pick some number from the given range.
#   We try to find d, such that (e * d) mod phi(n) = 1. This is Modular Inverse algorithm.
#   If d exists, the number e is okay. If the number is not okay, we pick different e and try again.
#   My implementation of Modular Inverse algorithm returns -1, if solution does not exist.
    d = 5
    e = 0
    while True:
        e = secrets.choice(range(1, phi(n)))
        if ModularInverse.modularInverse(e, d) > 0:
            break
