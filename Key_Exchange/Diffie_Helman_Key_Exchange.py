# Title: Diffie-Helman Key Exchange in Python
# Author: Micha≈Ç Kotecki
# Date: 4/29/2020
# Description:
# In the case, where two people want to send ciphered messages to one another, they both need to have the same key in order to cipher or decipher messages.
# One of the ways to achieve this is Diffie-Helman.
# Diffie-Helman is good, because the information they share as public is not enough to decipher messages.
# Modulo operation makes it very difficult to guess, what are the secret keys.
# Modulo function is kind of a 'Trap Door' function, because it is easy to do and hard to undo.
# Huge vulnerability: somebody can act as a middle-man between both sides of the communication.
# That person just establish his own secret key and act as thought, he is supposted to receive those messages.
# Than he decipher them and ciphers them again with his secret key and sends them to the proper receiver.
# Nobody can tell anything is wrong and Diffie-Helman does not provide any way to deal with this problem.

def Diffie_Helman_DEMO():
    # Numbers p and g are not secret. They can be public.
    p = 11  # p must be a prime number
    g = 4  # g can be any number

    # Number a_secret is secret, only one person in two-side communication knows it and NEVER shares it with anybody.
    # a_secret can be any number.
    a_secret = 8

    # Number is b_secret is only known by the other person.
    # b_secret can be any number.
    b_secret = 17

    # A_send will be send from owner of a_secret to the owner of b_secret.
    # B_send will be send from owner of b_secret to the owner of a_secret.
    A_send = pow(g, a_secret) % p
    B_send = pow(g, b_secret) % p

    # When both sides of the communication receive number A_send and B_send,
    # Both sides calculate their keys.
    A_key = pow(B_send, a_secret) % p
    B_key = pow(A_send, b_secret) % p

    # A_key should be equal B_key.
